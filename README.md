# SimCSV
A python script that visualizes csvs created by askfjh's overwatch ranked simulator.

dependencies: numpy
              matplotlib
              
To run the script type (minus the quotes) "python main.py $csv.csv" where $csv = the name of the csv you want to edit.

Programmed in python 3, backwards compatilbility is questionable at best.

SimCSV2 is a simple GUI version of the same program. Simply double click main.py and select your csv then click "run".
